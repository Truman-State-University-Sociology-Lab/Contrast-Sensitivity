	<p>Because the two of you will be working as a group today, we want to give both of you as much information as possible about Contrast Sensitivity ability.</p>
	<p>First, the assistants pointed out to you that Contrast Sensitivity is a perceptual ability which is not necessarily related to specialized skills an individual might possess, such as mathematical or artistic ability. That is, it is entirely possible that a person might be a very skilled artist, but not have very much Contrast Sensitivity ability. This means that individuals who do poorly in art or math may in fact be quite accurate in making Contrast Sensitivity judgements.</p>

	<p>At the present Time, social scientists are not sure what the origins of Contrast Sensitivity are. This is one reason why we are conducting today's study. We are interested in learning more about Contrast Sensitivity Ability</p>
	<p>During this part of the study, you and your partner will be working with a set of Contrast Sensitivity problems that look like the one shown on the next screen.</p>

	<p>As you can see, the format of these problems is slightly different from those you saw on the test you took earlier. However, these problems also require you to use your Contrast Sensitivity ability. This is just a different form of test involving Contrast Sensitivity ability. This for of the test is different from the one you saw earlier in that here we are asking you to examine two paterns and select which of the two patterns contains the greater amount of white area. In the test you took earlier, you saw only one pattern, and had to decide if there was more black or white area in that one pattern. However, both forms of these problems are ways of evaluating the presence or absence of Contrast Sensivity ability.</p>

	<p>You will probably find that some of these slides are very difficult to judge. This is due to the fact that the difference in the amount of white area between the two patterns is sometimes quite small. However, there is a right and a wrong answer to each and every slide, and we have found that persons with high Contrast Sensitivity consistently choose more correct answers than those with low Contrast Sensitivity. It is also the case that persons with high levels of Contrast Sensitivity ability may not be completely aware of how it is that they choose the right answer. They seem to be operating on the basis of very slight, almost intuitive cues and feelings. However, it is best to be cautious; guesses which are based on first impressions may often be incorrect.</p>

<div id="contrastInstruction5">
	<p>As noted, we are interested in how individuals and groups use their Contrast Sensitivity to solve problems. We have observed that in many situations, such as when a doctor diagnosis a difficult illness, individuals are called upon to make decisions that must be correct. That is, if the doctor does not make the right diagnosis, the patient might die. Social scientists refer to this kind of situation as a Critical Choice situation.</p>
	<p>In Critical Choice situations, when the person is concerned only with the correctness of the decision, he or she will often seek all the information and advice from others that is available. Because the most important thing in a Critical Choice situation is to be right, individuals will not care whether they or others first realize what the appropriate decision is, so long as the decision is the correct one. It is clear then, that exchanging information with others can often lead to more correct dicisions than an idividual could make working alone.</p>
	<p>In this study, we are interested in examining this kind of teamwork situation in greater detail. Consequently, we are going to give the two of you the opportunity to exchange information with each other as to what each of you think is the correct answer for each problem before you make your final decisions. You will use buttons that will appear on your computer screen to exchange this information with each other.</p>

	<p>This is how it will work...</p>
	<p>First, we will present a slide on the screen. After you have each studied the slide for five seconds, you will each be asked to make an initial choice as to which pattern cointains the greater area of white - the top pattern or the bottom pattern. This initial choice will let your partner know whether you think that the top figure or the bottom figure contains the greatest area of white. You will each indicate this choice by pressing a button on your screen that will be in a row labeled "Your Initial Choice."</p>
	<p>The next screen of instructions illustrates this...</p>

	<p>Look at the top row of buttons and lights in the above picture. You will have a panel that looks like this, and you will use it in solving the Contrast Sensitivity problems. You express your initial opinion by pressing either the button marked "Top" or the button marked "Bottom". When you have made your initial choice, it will be communicated to the other person, and you will be able to see the other person's opinion register on your panel. That is, on the row of lights on the panel labeled "Your Partner's Initial Choice," eight the bulb marked "Top" or the bulb marked "Bottom" will light up.</p>
	<p>Let's go through a practice trial, so that you can try this out. When you have both clicked on the button below ("Go to Practice Round"), you will see a screen with a picture of a Contrast Sensitivity problem. You will have five seconds to study the picture.

	<p>Now, we will explain our scoring procedures...</p>
	<p>As we have explained, you will be working together on 25 Contrast Sensitivity slides. Once the slide appears on your screen, you will have five seconds to make your initial choices as to which pattern cointains the greater area of white. Then, after you see your partner's choice, you will have five more seconds in which to make your final choices.</p>
	<p>Each time that a team member makes a correct final decision, the team will receive 1 point. If both team members make the correct final choice, the team will receive 2 points. If an individual makes an incorrect final decision, then that person's final decision adds nothing to the team score for that trial. Your team score will consist of the total number of correct final decisions made by both of you. Since there will be 25 trials, the maximum score your team can achieve is 50 points. This means that you both have equal responsibility for your team score.</p>
	<p>On the next screen, we will show you the pattern of scores that has been compiled from previous studies involving Contrast Sensitivity Ability.</p>

	<p>First, we have found that when individuals work alone at solving Contrast Sensitivity problems, 0 to 10 is a poor performance. 11 to 15 represents an average performance, and 16 to 25 is clearly a superior performance.</p>

	<p>In today's study, we are interested in seeing how well you can work together as a team. When people work together as partners, it  has been found that a team score falling between 0 and 26 constitutes a very poor team performance. A team score of 27 to 32 is below average performance. Scores of 33 to 40 represent an average team performance. 41 to 47 points represents an above average score. And, 48 to 50 points clearly represents a superior team performance.</p>

	<div class="instructionPicture"><img src="assets/images/contrast/scoring3.png"/></div>
	<p>As you can see from these standards, it has been demonstrated that teams working together are able to perform more effectively than two individuals working independently. For example, an individual with average ability working on these problems alone could expect to get between 11 and 15 correct. Thus, you might expect that two individuals working together might each get between 11 and 15 correct for a total score between 22 and 30. However, as the team results show, the average team score is quite a bit higher - between 33 and 40. This is because two people working together as a team, and exchanging information with each other can do better than two individuals working alone.</p>

	<p>2. Only your final decision on each slide will count toward your team score.</p>
	<p>3. Each time that one of you makes a correct final decision, your team will receive 1 point. If both of you choose correctly, your team receives 2 points. This means that incorect final decisions add nothing to your team score.</p>
	<p>4. There are some things we know about Contrast Sensitivity ability from our previous studies: First, there is no relationship, as far as we can see, between mathematical ability or artistic ability and Contrast Sensitivity.</p>
