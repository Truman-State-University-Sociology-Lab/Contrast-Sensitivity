	<p>Please make yourself comfortable but please do not touch any of the things on your desk until the instructions explain how to use them.</p>
	<p>We are members of a research team of social scientists who are interested in studying the application of various kinds of perceptual abilities. Currently, we are focusing on an important perceptual ability called "Contrast Sensitivity" ability.</p>
	<p>In the first part of this study, you took a test which measures individual levels of this ability. In this part of the study, we are going to be studying team ability levels. This means that you will be working with a partner to solve some more Contrast Sensitivity problems. Your partner for the study is in another room like the one you are in, and one of the research assistants has explained the study and administered the test to your partner just as it has been done for you. This means that you and your partner will be working as a group to solve more Contrast Sensitivity problems. We are handling today's study this way because of several recent studies which have been done on the effectiveness of individuals working together as a team. For many kinds of problems, these studies indicate that individuals working together perform much mor eeffectively than do individuals who work the same problems alone. For this reason, we will have you work with a partner as a team.</p>

	<p>Most of what we know about how two person teams solve problems comes from studies where the teams discussed problems and solutions to these problems face-to-face. However, advances in video and computer technology are providing more and more opportunities for individuals to work together to solve problems even when face-to-face interaction is not possible. Therefore, the study we are conducting today involves a situation in which the partners do not discuss possible solutions to problems face-to-face, but rather communicate their choices by means of modern communication networks. We have already utilized one part of this network - the computers we are now using. However, while you will not be solving the problems face-to-face, you will have the opportunity to introduce yourselves to one another by means of the computer system over which you are now receiving these instructions. We find that it helps people who work together to know something about each other.</p>
	<p>Let's demonstrate how the computer system works by introducing you to each other. On the next page, we have asked you to indicate your seat number for the study, along with some information about yourself. After you do this and click on the "Send Information" button at the bottom of the page, this information will be sent to your partner. When your partner has completed the information and clicks the button, you will see information about your partner. Click on the button below marked "Go to Next Page of Instructions" now to do this.</p>
